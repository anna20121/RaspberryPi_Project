# RaspberryPi_Project
IoT project, arduino collects data with three sensors and then sends as MQTT message to university open broker. Raspberry Pi is subscribed to created topic in Node-Red. Further visualizations are created.

In this project, the students were provided with a Raspberry Pi with a SenseHat addon and an Arduino Uno WiFi with three sensors. The main goal of the project was to automate the room that was given to students in the campus building, to implement IOT system and get data from it for further use. The basic features that were requested were getting data, formatting it to requested by teacher format and send it on common broker topic as MQTT message in JSON format. And implement visualization for real-time metering. Besides basic features additional functionality was added, such as light-bulb intensity value depending on brightness, data base storing (of data + alarm log), other rooms viewing and remote access. Work done satisfy goals set, summary on project was analysed and written.!
